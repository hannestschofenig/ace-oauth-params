      <t>This specification defines new parameters for the OAuth 2.0 token and
      introspection endpoints when used with the framework for authentication
      and authorization for constrained environments (ACE).
      These are used to express the proof-of-possession key the client
      wishes to use, the proof-of-possession key that the Authorization Server
      has selected, and the key the Resource Server should use to authenticate
      to the client.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

  <t>The Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
  specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/> requires some new
  parameters for interactions with the OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> token
  and introspection endpoints, as well as some new claims to be used in access
  tokens.  These parameters and claims can also be used in other contexts
  and have therefore been put into a dedicated document, to
  facilitate their use in a manner independent of
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>.</t>
  
  <t>Note that although all examples are shown in CBOR
  <xref target="RFC7049"/>, JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> MAY be used as an
  alternative for HTTP-based communications, as specified in
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>.</t>

  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref
target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

  <t>Readers are assumed to be familiar with the terminology from <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz"/>, especially the terminology
  for entities in the architecture such as client (C), resource server (RS)
  and authorization server (AS).</t>

  <t>Terminology from <xref target="RFC8152"/> is used in the examples,
  especially COSE_Key defined in section 7 of <xref target="RFC8152"/>.</t>  

  <t>Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth 2.0
  <xref target="RFC6749"/> definition, which is to denote resources such as
  token and introspection at the AS and authz-info at the RS.  The CoAP
  <xref target="RFC7252"/> definition, which is "An entity participating in the
  CoAP protocol" is not used in this specification.</t>

      <t>"cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL if using an
      asymmetric key or a key that the client requested via a key identifier
      in the request. REQUIRED if the client didn't specify a "req_cnf" and
      symmetric keys are used.  Used to indicate the symmetric key generated
      by the AS for proof-of-possession of the access token.</t>

      <t>"cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, REQUIRED if the
      access token that was subject to introspection is a proof-of-possession
      token, absent otherwise.  Indicates the proof-of-possession key bound
      to the access token.</t>
 
      <t>"rs_cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL to indicate the
      public key of the RS, if it uses one to authenticate itself to the client
      and the binding between key and RS identity is not established through
      other means.</t>

      <t>"rs_cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, OPTIONAL, contains
      the public key that the RS should use for authenticating itself to the
      client (e.g., if the RS has several different public keys, and there may
      be ambiguity as to which key to use).</t>
  </list></t>
      
  <t>Note that the COSE_Key structure in a confirmation claim or parameter
  may contain an "alg" or "key_ops" parameter.  If such parameters are
  present, a client MUST NOT use a key that is incompatible with
  the profile or proof-of-possession algorithm according to those
  parameters. An RS MUST reject a proof-of-possession using such a key.
  </t>

  <t>If an access token is issued for an audience that includes several RS,
  the "rs_cnf" parameter MUST NOT be used, since the client cannot
  determine for which RS the key applies.  This document recommends to
  specify a different endpoint that the client can use to acquire RS
  authentication keys in such cases.  The specification of such an endpoint

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
